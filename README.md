# mycontacts-app

## Introduction

This is an fronten-only app, created to study Vue.js and for a proposed challenge. The challenge was to create an responsive app to keep a contact list (create, update and delete) , with name, email and phone.

This app was built using Vue.js 2.x. Before this, I was never developed anything with Vue.js, but I already worked with Angular JS 1.x in previous works.
